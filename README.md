## 💡 Motivation

Many VPN clients, including official WireGuard and Cloudflare WARP clients, often require kernel-level access or route all system traffic through the tunnel by default. `cloudflare-warp` was created to provide a more flexible, lightweight, and cross-platform alternative.

## ✨ Features

- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Linux/macOS/Windows/FreeBSD/OpenBSD with platform-specific optimizations.
- **User-Space Networking**: Implements a user-space networking stack to handle traffic, avoiding the need for kernel-level privileges.
- **Proxy Support**: Includes support for HTTP and Socks5 proxies for secure and private browsing.
- **Full SOCKS Support:** Implements Socks5 with TCP (`CONNECT`) and UDP (`ASSOCIATE`) support.
- **DPI Evasion**: Utilizes techniques by `AmneziaWG` and `uTLS` helping to confuse Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) systems.
- **IP Scanner**: Built-in scanner to find the best Cloudflare WARP IP addresses with optimal RTT.

## 🚀 Installation

There are multiple ways to install `cloudflare-warp`.

### From GitHub Releases

You can download pre-compiled binaries for various operating systems and architectures from the [releases page](https://github.com/shahradelahi/cloudflare-warp/releases).

### Building from Source

Since the tool is written in Go, it should be rather trivial.

1. Ensure that you have Go installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://golang.org/dl/). At least Go 1.24.4 is required (as per `go.mod`).

2. Clone this repository and switch to the project's root directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shahradelahi/cloudflare-warp.git
   cd cloudflare-warp
   ```

3. Build the project using the `Makefile`:

   ```bash
   make cloudflare-warp
   ```

   The compiled binary will be located in the `build/` directory.

If you would rather cross compile, set the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables accordingly. For example, to build for Windows on a Linux system:

```bash
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 CGO_ENABLED=0 make cloudflare-warp
```

### Docker

You can also run `cloudflare-warp` using Docker. A `Dockerfile` is provided in the repository.

To build the image, run:

```bash
docker build -t cloudflare-warp .
```

Example usage (spawns a SOCKS proxy and exposes it on port 1080):

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name cloudflare-warp \
  -v ./warp-data:/var/lib/cloudflare-warp \
  -p 1080:1080 \
  --restart=unless-stopped \
  cloudflare-warp --socks-addr 0.0.0.0:1080
```
**Note:** Inside the container, the proxy must bind to `0.0.0.0` to be accessible from outside.

## ⚙️ Usage

Run `warp` in a terminal without any arguments to display the help screen. All commands and parameters are documented.

```bash
./warp --help
```

### Command-line Flags

Run `warp <command> --help` for detailed information on each command's flags.

### Register a new account

This command creates a fresh WARP account and saves the identity files.

```bash
warp generate
```

### Add a license key

If you have an existing Warp+ subscription, you can bind the account generated by this tool to your phone's account, sharing its Warp+ status. Please note that there is a limit of 5 maximum devices linked at a time. You can remove linked devices from the 1.1.1.1 app on your phone.

> [!CAUTION]
> Only subscriptions purchased directly from the official 1.1.1.1 app are supported. Keys obtained by any other means, including referrals, will not work and will not be supported.

First, get your Warp+ account license key. To view it on Android:
1. Open the `1.1.1.1` app
2. Click on the hamburger menu button in the top-right corner
3. Navigate to: `Account` > `Key`

Now, use the command below to update the account's name and license:

```bash
warp update --name "My Warp Device" --license "YOUR_LICENSE_KEY"
```

### Generate WireGuard configuration

This command generates and prints the WireGuard configuration based on your WARP identity.

```bash
warp generate
```

### Check device status

Run the following command in a terminal to check the status of your current Cloudflare Warp device:

```bash
warp status
```

### Verify Warp/Warp+ works

After connecting to the WARP proxy (see `Run the WARP proxy` section), you can verify that Warp/Warp+ is working by checking your IP address or visiting a Cloudflare trace page.

**Using `curl`:**

```bash
curl -x socks5://127.0.0.1:1080 https://cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/trace
# Or for HTTP proxy:
curl -x http://127.0.0.1:8118 https://cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/trace
```

Look for `warp=on` or `warp=plus` in the output.

**Using a web browser:**

Open your browser and navigate to `https://cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/trace/`. Look for `warp=on` or `warp=plus` on the page.

### Run the WARP proxy

This command starts the proxy server and establishes a connection to the Cloudflare network. You can configure the proxy to use Socks5 or HTTP, specify WARP endpoints, and enable features like WARP+ connections.

**Example: Run with a SOCKS5 proxy on port 1080 and an HTTP proxy on port 8118.**

```bash
warp run --socks-addr 127.0.0.1:1080 --http-addr 127.0.0.1:8118
```

**Example: Run with IP scanning enabled to find the best endpoint.**

```bash
warp run --scan --4 --rtt 500ms
```
This will scan for IPv4 endpoints with a maximum RTT of 500ms.

### Scan for the best WARP IP

This command scans for the best Cloudflare WARP IP addresses by testing a list of known CIDRs. It measures the Round-Trip Time (RTT) and displays a list of the fastest available endpoints. This is useful for finding optimal endpoints to use with the `run` command for better performance.

**Example: Scan for IPv4 endpoints with a maximum RTT of 1000ms.**

```bash
warp scanner --ipv4 --rtt 1000ms
```

## 📁 Configuration

For simplicity, the tool stores its identity and configuration in JSON files within a data directory. By default, this is `~/.cloudflare-warp` on Linux/macOS or a platform-specific equivalent. You can specify a different data directory using the `--data-dir` flag.

The primary configuration files are:
- `reg.json`: Contains your WARP registration ID, token, and private key. **Confidential.**
- `conf.json`: Contains your WARP account details (license, quota, etc.) and the WARP configuration (peers, interface addresses).

These files are automatically managed by the `warp` commands (e.g., `generate`, `update`).

## ⚡ Performance

The project is in active development, and performance is a continuous focus. While the official client leverages highly optimized implementations, `cloudflare-warp` aims to provide a robust user-space solution. Performance can vary based on network conditions and system resources.

## Go SDK

Package `sdk` embeds WARP proxies in another Go application. One client loads or
creates the WARP identity once; each proxy gets an independent userspace tunnel,
local port, and remote WARP endpoint IP.

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"log"
	"net/netip"
	"time"

	warpsdk "github.com/shahradelahi/cloudflare-warp/sdk"
)

func main() {
	ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
	defer cancel()

	// Loads an existing identity or generates reg.json/conf.json here.
	client, err := warpsdk.GenerateIdentity("/var/lib/my-app/warp")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	endpoints, err := client.Scan(ctx, warpsdk.ScanOptions{
		IPv4:   true,
		Limit:  2,
		MaxRTT: 500 * time.Millisecond,
		Timeout: time.Minute,
	})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	proxies := make([]*warpsdk.Proxy, 0, len(endpoints))
	for i, endpoint := range endpoints {
		proxy, err := client.NewProxy(ctx, warpsdk.ProxyConfig{
			ListenIP:   netip.MustParseAddr("127.0.0.1"),
			Port:       uint16(1080 + i),
			EndpointIP: endpoint.AddrPort.Addr(),
			EndpointPort: endpoint.AddrPort.Port(),
			// Protocol defaults to warpsdk.SOCKS5.
		})
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatal(err)
		}
		if err := proxy.Start(); err != nil {
			log.Fatal(err)
		}
		proxies = append(proxies, proxy)
	}

	<-ctx.Done()
	shutdownCtx, shutdownCancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 10*time.Second)
	defer shutdownCancel()
	for _, proxy := range proxies {
		if err := proxy.Shutdown(shutdownCtx); err != nil {
			log.Printf("proxy shutdown: %v", err)
		}
	}
}
```

`Scan` performs real WARP WireGuard handshakes and returns endpoints ordered by
RTT. `CheckEndpoint` checks one exact `netip.AddrPort`. `Start` is asynchronous;
use `Wait` or `WaitContext` to receive startup/runtime errors. `Shutdown` stops
one proxy and waits for its listener and tunnel. Use `Run` when a blocking call
is more convenient. Set `Protocol` to
`warpsdk.HTTP` for an HTTP CONNECT proxy. By default listeners bind only to
`127.0.0.1`; exposing a proxy via `0.0.0.0` or `::` should be done only with
appropriate network access controls.
